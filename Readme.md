# JSON to XLSX CONVERTER
## A handy tool to convert JSON files to Excel spreadsheets with the fields you want.


Do you have a JSON file that you want to convert to an Excel spreadsheet? Do you want to select which fields to include in the spreadsheet? If yes, then this tool is for you!

JSON to XLSX CONVERTER is fast, reliable, and free. Try it now and see for yourself! 😊

## Installation

🌐 Use the following [CSV to JSON Converter](https://example.com/csv-to-json) website to convert the CSV to JSON unless you are allergic to online tools.

📄 If you are already using JSON, make sure the format is correct and not some alien language.

📂 Clone the repository and copy or replace the JSON file. Ensure the name of the JSON file is `input.json`, or else it will be very lonely.

💻 Install `jq` and `python3` with the `xlsxwriter` package because they are your best friends in this task.

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
or
sudo yum install jq
```
🐍 Follow the Python documentation for installing Python3 and xlsxwriter using pip, as I can't do everything for you.

📝 In the Script.sh file at line number 22, understand the code and update your value that you want in the XLSX file. Don't ask me what value; you should know that by now.

🚀 Then, run the following command, which will generate output.xlsx file, hopefully without any errors.

```bash
./script.sh
or
sudo ~/script.sh sh
```
😊 Good luck and have fun!
